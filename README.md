## Introduction

This repo is the Wasserstein Auto-Encoders for Text and Image Generation from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01558) in Pytorch.

### Feature

- Transformer based (from scratch / from Huggingface) Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with **MMD metric** (WAE-MMD) for **text** generation
- Transformer based (from scratch / from Huggingface) Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with **adversarial metric** (WAE-adv) for **text** generation
- Transformer based (from scratch / from Huggingface) Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with **MMD metric and gradient penalty** (WAE-GP-MMD) for **text** generation
- Transformer based (from scratch / from Huggingface) Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with **adversarial metric and gradient penalty** (WAE-GP-adv) for **text** generation
- Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with adversarial metric (WAE-adv) for **image** generation (based on [https://github.com/schelotto/Wasserstein-AutoEncoders](https://github.com/schelotto/Wasserstein-AutoEncoders))
- Wasserstein Auto-Encoder with MMD metric (WAE-MMD) for **image** generation (based on [https://github.com/schelotto/Wasserstein-AutoEncoders](https://github.com/schelotto/Wasserstein-AutoEncoders))
